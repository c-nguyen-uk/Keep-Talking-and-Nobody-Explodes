Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (KTANE) is a game in which a group of bomb defusal experts need to give defusal instruction to a person trapped in a room with an active time bomb. Both parties will need to verbally communicate since the experts cannot see the bomb.

This toolkit is designed to assist the bomb experts with the defusal of certain difficult bomb modules.
